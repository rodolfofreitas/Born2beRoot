  This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.
  
  You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox)
  under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up
  your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

#### Partitions Size
  Set up partitions correctly so you get a structure similar to the one below:
  
  boot    - 525m<p>
  root    - 10.7G<p>
  swap    - 2.5G<p>
  home    - 5.4G<p>
  var     - 3.2G<p>
  srv     - 3.2G<p>
  tmp 	  - 3.2G<p>
  var-log	- 4.3G
